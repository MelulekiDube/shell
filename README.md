# Meluleki Shell

This is a basic shell written in C [this tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/). More features are to implemented as time goes on.

## Getting Started

Program can be run on any unix system as most of the systmes calls and headers used are specific to unix systems.
To run the program one will need to first compile the code. This can be done simply as below:
1. ``make`` to compile
2. ``make run`` to run the executable built
3. ``make clean`` to clean the executable and build files

### Prerequisites

You just need a linux system with a c compiler.

## Contributing

This is more of a personal project for learning different things and therefore no contributions needed.

## Acknowledgments

* [Stephen Brennan](https://brennan.io/) for the awesome tutorial.
